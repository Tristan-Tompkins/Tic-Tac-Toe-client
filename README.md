## Technologies used

+ HTML
+ CSS + SASS
+ Javascript + jQuery
+ Bootstrap

## Planning and Development

Planning:
1. Start coding
2. Refactor and complete small goals that lead up to a big goal
3. After making progress, go back and check if what was done makes anything on the to-do list


#### My Process

1. Start coding
2. Build HTML
2. Complete auth event handlers with skeleton from previous work
3. Complete game event handlers except PATCH
4. Complete onUpdateGame
5. Refactor into smaller files, more folders
6. Build game logic
7. Refactor game logic
10. Add view onPageLoad handlers
11. Refactor game logic into its own folder
12. Add bootstrap navbar, nav dropdowns
13. Refactor into smaller files, more folders
15. Receive feedback and update
16. Fill in ReadME

#### Initial wireframes and user stories

1. As a user, I want to sign up.
2. As a user, I want to sign in.
3. As a user, I want to change passwords.
4. As a user, I want to sign out.
5. As a user, I want to play a new game.
6. As a user, I want to see previous games.
7. As a user, I want to go to a previous game.
8. As a user, I want to see how the code works.
9. As a user, I want to see a demonstration of the code.

## Problem Solving Strategy

1. Break down problems into smallest solvable problem and build up.
2. Take a break after certain amount of time regardless of progress.
3. Write down diagrams if stuck.
4. Explain code to peers for different approaches to solve the problem.

##Future Plans

In the future I would like to add some additional SCSS to make it more appealing to the user. Add a theme selector for the different races of the WoW game letting thee user choose. Also allow the an Ai that the user can interact with. Adding additional features such a history of games and a multiplayer aspect with leaderboards.
